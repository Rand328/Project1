## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## Run the project

To run the project, open the terminal in VS Code or in your terminal in the folder where your project is located. run the command `npm install` to install the needed files or ensure that you have them. then run `npm run dev`.
Keep it running and open a different terminal and go to the same location as the first terminal. Here we are going to set the database connection. Open xampp and start your Apache and mySQL, then go back to your terminal and run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`. If it refuses to migrate because it didn't finf the database "laraveldb", run the migration and seeding steps seperatly as follows: 

`php artisan migrate`
`php artisan db:seed`

This would solve your problem.
Finally, when that is all set we can run the project. In your terminal run the following command: `php artisan serve` and open the link you get.
